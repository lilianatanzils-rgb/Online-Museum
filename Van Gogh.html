            Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter, 
            known for his bold colors, expressive brushwork, and emotional depth.
            Although he struggled financially and mentally during his life, 
            he produced more than 2,000 artworks, including around 900 paintings.
